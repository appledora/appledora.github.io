The purpose of this research endeavor is to address this limitation by exploring automated approaches to pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images, while maintaining a high level of accuracy. I conducted a comprehensive investigation of various machine learning methods, including Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, several modified Convolutional Neural Networks, and the Vision Transformer. Moreover, I examined the utility of transfer learning techniques and assessed the performance of each of the different models
