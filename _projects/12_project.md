In this study, we seeked to address the following key questions:
• Performance: How do statistical methods, Transformers, zero-shot learning strategies, few-shot finetuning, and low-rank adaptation techniques compare in terms of accuracy and robustness across different
medical imaging datasets?
• Generalization: To what extent can existing state-of-the-art methods be leveraged to perform inference
in unseen settings specifically in the medical domain?
• Insights: What meaningful observations can be made from the outcome?
