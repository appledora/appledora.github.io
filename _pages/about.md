Hello there!! I am a CS PhD student at Boston University, advised by Prof. [Bryan Plummer](https://bryanplummer.com/) on topics related to **multimodal learning** and **parameter-efficient finetuning**. My research interest lies at the crosssection of **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision**, with a special emphasis on **responsible applications** and **under-resourced domains**.

- I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Isaac Johnson](https://isaacjoh.com/) and [Dr. Martin Gerlach](https://martingerlach.github.io/about/) at the **Wikimedia Research Team**, where I built resources and pipelines for NLP research across the Wikimedia projects.
- - I have **published** in multiple A* conferences and workshops, including Interspeech, NeuRIPS, EMNLP, and CVPR. A full list of my publications can be found [here](/publications). 
- I have a year of **industry experience** as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Giga Tech Ltd.](https://gigatechltd.com/), where I worked on developing the *National Syntactic TreeBank for Bangla.*  I am also a Research Collaborator at [Bengali.ai](https://bengaliai.github.io/), where I work on building resources for low-resource languages.
- I also build different **open-source tools** and **datasets** to support the larger community. Some of my projects can be found [here](/projects).

Outside research and courseworks, I am interested in plantsü™¥, pottery üè∫ and pop-culture üññ. Shoot me an email if you want to collaborate on a project, have a question, or just want to say hi~
