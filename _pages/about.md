Hello there!! I am a PhD student at Boston University, advised by Prof. [Bryan Plummer](https://bryanplummer.com/) on topics related to **multimodal learning** and **vision-language problems**. My research interest lies at the crosssection of **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision**, with a special emphasis on **responsible applications** and **under-resourced domains**.

Prior to joining BU, I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Isaac Johnson](https://isaacjoh.com/) and [Dr. Martin Gerlach](https://martingerlach.github.io/about/) at the Wikimedia Research Team, where I built resources and pipelines for NLP research across the Wikimedia projects. I also have a year of industry experience as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Giga Tech Ltd.](https://gigatechltd.com/), where I worked on developing the `National Syntactic TreeBank for Bangla`. 

Outside research and courseworks, I am interested in plants, pottery and pop-culture. Shoot me an email if you want to collaborate on a project, have a question, or just want to say hi~
